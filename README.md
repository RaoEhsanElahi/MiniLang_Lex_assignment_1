# CS 424 - MiniLang Scanner

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a MiniLang scanner implemented for the CS 424 assignment at GIK Institute.

## Objectives

- Understand the complexities of lexical analysis.
- Design and implement a scanner for a simple programming language (MiniLang).
- Develop and explore test cases for the scanner.

## Requirements

- **Language Specifications:**
  - Data Types: Integer, Boolean.
  - Operators: +, -, \*, /, =, ==, !=.
  - Keywords: if, else, print, true, false.
  - Identifiers: Start with a letter followed by letters and digits.
  - Literals: Integer and Boolean literals.
  - Comments: Single-line comments starting with //.
- **Implementation:**
  - Read MiniLang source code from a file and tokenize it.
  - Use a finite state machine (C++ or Python) to recognize tokens.
  - Output a list of tokens with type and lexeme.
  - Handle lexical errors.
- **Documentation:**
  - Design decisions, scanner structure, and program execution instructions.
  - Test cases including edge cases.

## Usage

**Prerequisites:**

- C++ or Python compiler

**Running the Scanner:**
